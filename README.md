# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

Sorting Algorithms Visualizer is a web app created to visualize the operations of various sorting algorithms. 

Test the web app out [here](https://ianc13.github.io/Sorting-Algo-Visualizer/)!

## Description

Motivation for this project was to create a vizualization tool to aid in the understanding of the operations of different sorting algorithms whilst learning [React.js](https://reactjs.org/).

This application was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and built using React.js.

## Implemented Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort

## Future Features 

- An alternative mode in the app with a cell based view of an array where each step of the algorithms can be stepped through to get a better understanding in the operations.
- More algorithms
